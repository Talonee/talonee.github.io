							<h1 class="major">Cozmo</h1>
							<p>During Summer 2019, I was offered an opportunity to participate in the STEM Success program at California
								State University, Stanislaus â€” the program seeks to further engage underserved and low-income students in 
								comprehensive, year-round programming dedicated to improving retention, persistence, and graduation of 
								undergraduates in math and science disciplines. As a part of the program, other students and I were involved
								in researches with professors from various departments.
							</p>
							<p>My team researched with Cozmo, a mini AI robot, and were tasked with researching on how we could use Cozmo
								to introduce the concept of AI to the general public. Through programmable actions, computer vision,  
								image recognition, and its cutesy appearance, the audience could interact and play with Cozmo as they would with a pet.
